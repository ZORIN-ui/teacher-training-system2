## üíæ Google Drive Backup Strategy

Since Google Drive cannot host Flask apps directly, use it for backup:

### Automated Backup Script
Create a backup script that:
1. Exports your database
2. Packages your code
3. Uploads to Google Drive

### Manual Backup
1. Compress your entire project folder
2. Upload to Google Drive
3. Share folder with team members

---

## üîß Production Configuration

### Environment Variables
Set these for production:
```
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=False
PORT=5000
```

### Database Considerations
- SQLite works for small teams (< 100 users)
- For larger deployments, consider PostgreSQL
- Regular database backups recommended

---

## üìä Monitoring and Testing

### Health Check Endpoint
Your app includes `/health` endpoint for monitoring:
```
GET /health
Response: {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "...", "version": "1.0.0"}
```

### Mobile Testing Checklist
- [ ] Login/logout functionality
- [ ] Course browsing
- [ ] Module viewing
- [ ] Admin panel access
- [ ] Enrollment requests
- [ ] Progress tracking

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor response times
- Check mobile loading speeds
- Test on different devices
- Monitor user activity

## üîê Security for Public Deployment

### Essential Security Measures
1. **Change Default Credentials**
   - Update admin password from `admin123`
   - Use strong passwords

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit passwords to code
   - Use environment variables for secrets

3. **HTTPS Only**
   - All recommended platforms provide HTTPS
   - Never use HTTP for production

4. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Monitor for security issues

---

## üìû Support and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor user registrations
- Approve enrollments
- Check system health
- Backup database

### Troubleshooting
- Check application logs
- Monitor error rates
- Test mobile compatibility
- Verify database integrity

## üéØ Quick Start Commands

### For Ngrok Testing:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start app
python app.py

# Terminal 2: Create tunnel
ngrok http 5000
```

### For Production Deployment:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect to Render/Railway
3. Deploy automatically
4. Get permanent mobile URL
